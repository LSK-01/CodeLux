- After creating a project, you will be forwarded to the overview page for that project, displaying all the relevant information for the project. This is also the page where code analysis can be run and the project can be marked as complete. This page is accessible from the dashboard and the projects list page.
- Then, it is recommended that you navigate to the dashboard, which will display the project you have just added and any others you may have. Here, you will be able to view the number of projects at risk, overdue projects and those with upcoming deadlines, surveys and tasks. Only project managers will be able to see if a project is at risk, but all project members can take surveys and complete tasks for their projects.
- Surveys for projects can be taken from the dashboard. Project members are reminded to take surveys weekly. Tasks for projects include running code analysis for the project source code. Project members are encouraged to run code analysis weekly. Notifications of tasks and surveys will appear in the dashboard when due.
